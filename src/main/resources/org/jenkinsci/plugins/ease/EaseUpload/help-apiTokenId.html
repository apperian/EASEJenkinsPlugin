        Select an API token valid for your Apperian organization. To include a new API token in this list, add a new credential in the list of credentials of the configuration of Jenkins (Jenkins &gt; Credentials). The type of that new credential has to be &quot;Secret Text&quot;. After including it you will see it here with the description you have set.
    </p>
    <p>
        The associated user to that API token must have valid permissions for adding applications to Apperian.
        Based on this User ID, the Apperian web service identifies your organization in the Apperian database.
        For more information on user permissions, see Managing Users
        (<a href="https://help.apperian.com/display/pub/Managing+Users">https://help.apperian.com/display/pub/Managing+Users</a>)
